Twitter Feed
=============================================

The purpose of the project is to make some experimentation with twitter feeds in order to get an idea on how to
structure the tweets in order to make them available in a timely fashion when their number grows.

Tweets are imported via a quartz job directly from Twitter and stored in a Postgres database.
